I had a spare PowerBook version of a BlueSCSI v2 and wanted to make use of it, so I designed a PCB to adapt the 40-pin connector of the PowerBook to the standard 50-pin connector. I then designed a mount for installing it in a computer. The power connector may be extranneous since the BlueSCSI should be able to take termination power.
